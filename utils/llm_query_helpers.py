Your task is to classify the user's input into one of the following categories:

- conversation â†’ for greetings, small talk, or general questions about you, the system, or data storage (e.g., "hello", "how are you", "who are you", "where do you store data?")
- candidate â†’ for technical queries about candidates, their skills, education, work experience, projects, asked to return candidates cv or resume , or any question that would require generating a Cypher query to search the candidate database (e.g., "show me candidates with Python skills", "who studied at Harvard?", "find candidates with 3+ years experience")
User input: "{query}"

Return only one word: **conversation** or **candidate**.

Do not explain. Do not include punctuation or extra words. Return just the category name.

def candidate_query_to_cypher(user_query, schema, llm):
    prompt = f"""
You are an expert in Cypher and Neo4j. You are given a knowledge graph schema and must only use nodes, relationships, and properties that exist in the schema as follows:
{schema}

Your task is to generate a Cypher query to answer the user's question. Follow ALL instructions strictly:
---

Instructions:
1. Use **case-insensitive** and **partial** matching on string properties:
   - Use `toLower(property) CONTAINS toLower("keyword")`
   - Applies to all string filters.

2. Output **only the Cypher query**:
   - No explanations, comments, or markdown
   - Valid, concise, complete Cypher

3. Resume Queries:
   - If user query contains keywords like "resume", "cv", "list candidate", "give me candidate", "who are", "their resumes", "show resumes of", etc:
     - Return only distinct candidate names with filters:
       RETURN DISTINCT c.name
     - Match related nodes as needed for filtering (skills, education, experience)

4. **WITH Clause**
   - Always pass forward all needed variables.
   - Use aliases consistently after aliasing.

5. **Aggregation**
   - Use `sum(w.years)` for total experience when asked.
   - Use `DISTINCT` inside `collect()` to avoid duplicates.

6. **For avoiding reverse duplicates**
   - Use `c1 <> c2` to avoid reverse duplicates.

7. **MATCH Usage**
   - Use `MATCH` for required conditions.
   - Use `OPTIONAL MATCH` only for fetching additional details.

8. **DISTINCT usage**
    - Use `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates from the results.

9. **Filter usage**
    - Use `WHERE` to filter the results based on user query.
    - Use `ORDER BY` to sort the results based on user query.

10. **Limit usage**
    - Use `LIMIT` to limit the number of results returned based on user query.

11. ** Partial Entity Matching**
    - Break multi-word inputs (e.g. "biplav ghale") into parts (["biplav", "ghale"]) and match each part separately using AND or OR conditions for better fuzzy matching.
    - Apply the logic to all relevant nodes, not just Candidate, and to any property being filtered.


12. **return**
    - Use `RETURN` to return the results based on user query.

some examples:
if asked about "any 5 candidate who 2 years of experience in python"
MATCH (c:Candidate)-[:WORKED_IN]->(w:Work)
WHERE w.years = 2 AND toLower(w.position) CONTAINS toLower("python")
RETURN DISTINCT c.name LIMIT 5

if asked about "any candidates who have same skills" , follow same logic for other too.
MATCH (c1:Candidate)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill)<-[:HAS_SKILL]-(c2:Candidate)
WHERE toLower(c1.name) < toLower(c2.name)
WITH c1, c2, COLLECT(DISTINCT toLower(s.name)) AS sharedSkills
RETURN c1.name AS candidate1, c2.name AS candidate2, sharedSkills


if asked about cv of candidate who has work for 2 or more years in java
MATCH (c:Candidate)
WHERE (EXISTS {{
    MATCH (c)-[:WORKED_IN]->(w:Work)
    WHERE w.years >= 2 AND toLower(w.position) CONTAINS toLower("jav")
}}) 
OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill)
OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:STUDIED_IN]->(edu:Education)
OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:WORKED_IN]->(work:Work)
OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:HAS_PROJECT_ON]->(proj:Project)
RETURN
    c.name,
    c.email,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT s.name) AS skills,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT {{university: edu.university, degree: edu.degree}}) AS education,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT {{company: work.company, position: work.position, years: work.years}}) AS workExperience,
    COLLECT(DISTINCT proj.name) AS projects

If asked about specific candidate/ or their resume or cv, return all the details of that candidate.
