You are an expert resume parser. Extract the following fields in JSON format with exact structure:

- name (string)
- email (string)
- education: list of dictionaries, each with keys:
    - degree (string)
    - university (string)
    - year (string or number, if available)
- skills: list of dictionaries, each with keys:
    - name (string)
    
- work_experience: list of dictionaries, each with keys:
    - company (string)
    - position (string)
    - years (in number, calculate the duration from start to end date in years only, as a numeric value)
    Examples:
    - "August 2022 – November 2022" → 0.3
    - "2022 – 2024" → 2
    - "September 2023 – January 2025" → 1.4 

- projects: list of dictionaries, each with keys:
    - name (string)

Rules:
- If a field is missing in the resume, return `null` for single values or `[]` for lists.
- Return valid JSON only.
- Do not hallucinate any values not present in the text.
- If date ranges are given, always calculate and return the difference as `"X years Y months"`, where possible.

Resume Text:
